In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.

Example

For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 33.

3710 = 1001012 ~> 1000012 = 3310.

For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 37.

The 4th bit is 0 already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still 37.
*/
function killKthBit(n, k) {
  return n-((2**(k-1))&n);
}

killKthBit(37,3)

/*
You are given an array of up to four non-negative integers, each less than 256.

Your task is to pack these integers into one number M in the following way:

The first element of the array occupies the first 8 bits of M;
The second element occupies next 8 bits, and so on.
Return the obtained integer M.

Note: the phrase "first bits of M" refers to the least significant bits of M - the right-most bits of an integer. For further clarification see the following example.

Example

For a = [24, 85, 0], the output should be
arrayPacking(a) = 21784.

An array [24, 85, 0] looks like [00011000, 01010101, 00000000] in binary.
After packing these into one number we get 00000000 01010101 00011000 (spaces are placed for convenience), which equals to 21784.

function arrayPacking(a) {
    return a.reduceRight((aByte, bByte) => (aByte << 8) + bByte);
}
